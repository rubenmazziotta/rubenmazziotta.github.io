<ul>

  <li>Halogens are five elements on the 7th row of the periodic table.</li>

  <li>The names of the five halogens are as followed: Fluorine,
    Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine and Astatine.</li>

  <li>Halogens are very reactive and most of them
    can cause harm.
<li>The halogens have different boiling points
    and different physical properties. 

<li>Chlorine is used in swimming pools to kill
  bacteria.

<li>Salt is made from the elements of halogens.

<li>Fluoride is used in toothpaste! Luckily it
  doesn't hurt us.
