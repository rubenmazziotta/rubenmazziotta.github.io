<h3>Dukkha</h3>


<h4>Meaning of Dukkha</h4>

<p>
  Dukkha is a word in the Buddhist religion that is commonly known as
  suffering or stress.</p>

<h4>Do I agree with this?</h4>

<p>I would sort of agree with this because it's alright for Buddhist people
  to have their own word for suffering and pain so they don't have to use a
  word that isn't nice but at the same time I don't
agree with this because they don't really need a word for suffering and pain
  they could just say the two words.</p>
