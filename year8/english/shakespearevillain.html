<h3>100 word summary of Shakespeare villains</h3>

<p> All of Shakespeare's villains might be stubborn, guilty for doing
  something, smart or maybe the villain could have committed a crime
  like murder. Sometimes the villain gets killed or is put in prison and
  they might even cause chaos. Shakespeare's villains always act normal
  and act like they did nothing wrong but are always caught doing something
  fishy like killing someone which has already mentioned. Sometime or later
  in all of Shakespeare's plays/books the villain is found out to be guilty
  like in the book Macbeth. Shakespeare is great at making villains and
  mostly has them in his books and plays and even though he died he is still
known as one of the best playwrighter in England.</p>
