On the 11th of March 2017 I took my family to Bletchley park. We saw the items
people used in the world war II (2). Some people in the world war use to crack
messages from the Germans. One man called Alan Turing decrypted one of Hitler's
message and that helped us to win the war. Alan Turing died on the 7th June
1954. When Alan Turing was at school he was awarded lots of prizes and he was
top in math. Alan Turing is still famous and is very popular.

The Enigma machine was used for the Germans to communicate to each other in
private by encrypting the message. Morse code was using a radio and instead of
it saying letters it went beep. They used Morse code to stop their enemys
(i.e. the British) to know what they were saying. encryption is when you turn
normal writing into messy writing (not all the letters were different) and
decryption is when you turn messy writing into normal writing.
