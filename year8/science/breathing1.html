<h1>How fish and insects breathe by Ruben Mazziotta</h1>

<h2>How fish breathe</h2>

<p>Fish have gills and the way they works is the gills open when the fish
  needs air and when the gills open the water
  is passed through the gills. Next cells in the gills absorb the oxygen that
  is in the water; then blood passes the oxygen around the fish's body and
  then is returned as carbon dioxide which is released into the water.</p>

<h2>How insects breathe</h2>

<p>Breathing for insects takes place through the tracheae. Tracheae are tube
  structures that open on the insect's body through little holes called
  spiracles and each trachea has 4 tiny tubes which are named tracheoles.
  Air goes into the spiracles and all around the body of the insect and gives
  oxygen to the cells.</p>
