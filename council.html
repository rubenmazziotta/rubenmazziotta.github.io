I want to help students in things


I am keen to listen to other students and to help students that
don't have anyone to talk to.

I want to help make the school a better place, and more enjoyable
for students.

I want to help students that feel lonely have more friends.

I would like to change the amount of time we get for lunch by
adding five minutes and taking away five minutes from break. That
will mean that students that go to the canteen at lunch will get
more time to eat their food as there is always a big queue.
