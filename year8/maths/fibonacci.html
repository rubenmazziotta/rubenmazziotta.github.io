<p>This is an example of the fibonacci pattern.</p>

<p>The way a fibonacci pattern works is that the first two numbers are added
  (example 1+2=3) then it keeps on going like it's shown on the image.</p>

<p>This is an example of how the pattern should go: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13...</p>

<p>The number is always added up by the previous number in a fibonacci
  pattern.</p>

<p>A fibonacci pattern can go on forever until the person writing it will
  stop.</p>
