Geometry Dash is a kind of sequel from a game called The Impossible Game.
The Impossible game was made before Geometry Dash.

To play geometry dash you have to tap/click or press the spacebar to jump and
your goal is to get to the end of the level without dying.
</p>
<p>
There are two modes to complete a level. You can play on practice mode were
if you die you respawn at a checkpoint and normal mode is when you have no
checkpoints and you have to complete the level without diying.
</p>
<p>
You can also play the level editor mode. The level editor mode is where you
can build and share your own levels and you can also see other people's
levels.

<p>
When I wrote this web page the geometry dash version I was on was the 2.1
update and I'm hoping for the 2.2 update to come out.
