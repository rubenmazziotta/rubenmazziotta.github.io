<h1>How fish and insects breathe by Ruben Mazziotta</h1>

<h2>How fish breathe</h2>

<p>Fish have gills. The gills work by opening when the fish is in
  need for air which sends water into the gills. Next cells in the gills
  absorb the oxygen that
  is in the water; then blood passes the oxygen around the fish's body and
  returns as carbon dioxide which is released into the water.</p>

<h2>How insects breathe</h2>

<p>Breathing for insects takes place through the tracheae. Tracheae are tube
  structures that open on the insect's body through little holes called
  spiracles and each trachea has 4 tiny tubes which are named tracheoles.
  Air travels into the spiracles and all around the body of the insect giving
  oxygen to all the cells.</p>
