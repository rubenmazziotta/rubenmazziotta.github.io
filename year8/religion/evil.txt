One of these statements MUST be false

Alice wants ALL these facts to be TRUE.

But Bob points out that one of these facts MUST be false!!
They can't ALL be true at the same time!

Therefore, Alice has a BIG PROBLEM!!!



1. God exists
2. God is all-loving   
3. God is all-powerful   
4. God is all-knowing   
5. Evil things happen  


Some people want ALL these above statements to be TRUE. But that is IMPOSSIBLE!

Why did Luna die?

Because God wanted her to?  God is Evil
Because God couldn't stop her dying? God is not all-powerful
Because God didn't know she was crossing the road? God is not all-knowing
Because she just did, and there is no God to stop her


Another way of saying it is 'IF there is a (existing,all-loving,knowing,powerful) God, WHY then is there EVIL?'.


The 'problem of evil'



What happens if a unstoppable canonball, hits an unbreakable wall?


Two logical statements:

1. There exists at least one unstoppable canonball
2. There exists at least one unbreakable wall

LOGICAL CONTRADICTION!

means - they CANNOT be true at the same time.


1. You cannot have more than one meal tonight
2. You have Indian
3. You have Pizza


BECAUSE ITS IMPOSSIBLE
