<h3>The link between palm oil and deforestation</h3>

<img style="width:30%" src="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.0mSuk027VkwwZFIyGHzt2QHaE7%26pid%3D15.1&f=1">

<p>A reason why palm oil is linked to deforestation is that palm oil is grown
  on trees and to get the palm oil the tree has to be cut down.
  If this continued we would start to lose palm oil trees and we will lose
  forests if it gets worse and we could lose our food supply.</p>

<p>Palm oil is useful because it can be used as a medicine for children or
  adults and also for pregnancy (but it isn't fully
  safe) and is used for shampoo so losing palm oil could be a risk.
  Palm oil can also prevent from having vitamin A deficiency, cancer, brain
  disease and more.</p>

<p>Palm oil is killing animals because we cut down the palm
  trees to get the palm oil from the leaves and maybe even from the tree
  itself and mostly there can be animals in that tree and if the tree is cut
  down then that animal will have to find food in other areas of the forest
  which could lead to them getting killed and if they had a baby that baby
  won't have a mother anymore to give it food and then that baby might die
  as well which will lead to species becoming endangered and might even go
  extinct.</p>

 <p>Palm oil is grown in Malaysia and Indonesia and that is be
  where most animals are struggling to survive.</p>
