<p>(This is what is happening in Borneo)</p>


<p>Deforestation is when a forest gets cleared or has the trees removed or
  cut down from that forest. Deforestation happens for lots of reasons like
  cutting down the trees so the trees can be used for building or to make
  paper and also to make fuel like charcoal or timber.</p>

<h3>2: Negative impacts of deforestation.</h3>

<p>Problems with deforestation is that we will lose lots of trees which
  means there will be more carbon dioxide in the air and it will be harder for
  wildlife to have a shelter or have any area to live in. If deforestation
  carried on then there will be less birds because most birds nest in trees
  and if most trees were getting cut down less birds would have a chance to
  survive and mabye might go extinct! Another impact could be that there will
  not be as much areas for us to walk through and explore. It might just look
  like a desert if we don't control deforestation.</p>
