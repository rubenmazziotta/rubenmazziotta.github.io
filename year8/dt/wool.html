<h2>Wool manufacturing</h2>   

<p>To wear wool it has to be sheared off sheep and knitted to make
  it's form of scarve or something else. This is most the process
  of how wool is shown when you use it.</p>

<h3>Shearing the sheep</h3>

<p>1: The sheep has it's wool sheared off but that only happens
  once a year but still a shepard can shear about 200 sheep per
  day!</p>

<h3>Grading and sorting</h3>

<p>2: After shearing a sheep the next thing that happens is grading
  and sorting. Grading is when the fleece gets broken up by the
  overall quality. when sorting the wool it is broken up into
  different sections of different quality fibers from the different
  part of the sheeps body.</p>

<h3>Cleaning the wool</h3>

<p>3: When wool is sheared off a sheep it is also known as "raw"
  or "grease wool" which means that the wool is dirty (has sand,
  dirt,grease and dried sweat) and needs to be cleaned.</p> 

  <h3>Carding wool</h3>
  
<p>4: Wool is passed through alot of metal teeth that straightens
  the wool and blends it into slivers.</p>

<h3>Spinning</h3>

<p>5: Wool is made into thread by spinning the fibers together and
  that makes one strand of yarn.</p>

<h3>Weaving</h3>

<p>6: After spinning the wool into yarn it is woven into fabric.
  There are two fabrics one is loose and soft and one is tight
  and smooth.</p>

<h3>Finishing</h3>

<p>After doing everything from shearing the sheep to making the
  wool into fabric it is washed which makes it smaller then it is
  ready to be used.</p>
